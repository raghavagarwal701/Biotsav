    <h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>The indomitable passion and quest, for the unexplored and the sublime, is the very essence of humanity. Here at
      “Biotsav”, we celebrate the triumph of new ideas and thoughts, at the same time rejoicing the mysteries of life
      through the eye-piece of science. Moreover, what better way to do it than to bring both the creative and intuitive
      together in one great confluence of ideas. In November, India will witness its FIRST AND BIGGEST BIOSCIENCES &
      BIOENGINEERING FEST, BIOTSAV’19 (for all engineering, medical and science background students who are working in the
      area of biology-based applications), a fest, rightful to be the torch-bearer in the blossoming avenue of
      Biotechnology. The motto of Biotsav’19 is the fusion of interdisciplinary fields with biology (Biofusion) for
      innovation and entrepreneurship. We humbly accept the legacy that IIT KHARAGPUR bequeaths upon us and we vow to form
      a rich bond with our beloved sponsors who after all are the very pillars upon which this “bastion of the future”
      stands. We look forward to having a cherished relationship with you, a relationship based on this firm hope that one
      day, our mutual juxtaposition would amount to the flame of Biotechnology glowing with ever-increasing glory of our
      nation.</p>

      <p id="about_txt">With rapid growth, development, and availability of ample opportunity in the field of
        Bio-Engineering; government along with major private sector companies have started working and exploring this
        uncharted territory. A variety of innovation and cutting-edge research in various fields is starting to converge
        towards bio-based solutions. In this era of new India, we believe in a future where Bio-Engineering/bio-based
        solutions/bio-mimetics will provide solutions to major fundamental challenges globally and locally. That is why
        there is an ever-increasing need for collaboration among young, energetic brains, with the help of expert
        industrialists, and academic professors from various disciplines to work on developing working prototypes against
        various challenges starting with healthcare challenges to many more. We envisage that BioEnGene will provide a
        platform that can facilitate this collaboration and also provide students with opportunity and awareness regarding
        the same.</p>

      <p>Continuous cross-questioning, trying not to leave anything unanswered while designing the research methodology
        and planning the experiments before proceeding for the execution and subsequent testing. In order to break the
        randomness and to bring the plan into reality for a working prototype, we focus mainly in cross-validation with
        theoretical testing from all possible dimensions with realistic simulations which will avoid the possible chances
        of failure resulting in the effective utilization of national funds in a way contributing to our nation.
